# GoodTasks

SwiftUI project for the Swift workshop for the GoodGrowth conference.

## Instructions

The default branch (`main`) points to the initial point for the project, just
after creating a new project in Xcode.

To jump to the finished project you can checkout the `finished` branch.

To jump to any step you can checkout `stepn` tags (`step1`, `step2`, etc).
